            <h2 class="sub">First human (Russian) in space</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            By 1959, some American observers had predicted that the Soviet Union
            would be the first to get a human into space because of the time
            needed to prepare for Mercury's first launch. On April 12, 1961, the
            USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a
            single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1. They
            dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian
            and Greek as "sailor of the universe". Although he had the ability
            to take control of his capsule in an emergency by opening an
            envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be
            typed into the computer, it was flown in an automatic mode as a
            precaution; medical science at that time did not know what would
            happen to a human in the weightlessness of space. Vostok 1 orbited
            the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet
            Union, with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters
            (23,000 ft), and landing by parachute
          </p>

            <h2 class="sub">First American in space</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            The US Air Force had been developing a program to launch the first
            man in space, named Man in Space Soonest. This program studied
            several different types of one-man space vehicles, settling on a
            ballistic re-entry capsule launched on a derivative Atlas missile,
            and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots. After NASA's
            creation, the program was transferred over to the civilian agency
            and renamed Project Mercury on November 26, 1958. On May 5, 1961,
            Alan Shepard became the first American in space, launching in a
            ballistic trajectory on Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named
            Freedom 7. Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin, he was the
            first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft's
            attitude and retro-rocket firing. After his successful return,
            Shepard was celebrated as a national hero, honored with parades in
            Washington, New York and Los Angeles, and received the NASA
            Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy.

            <h2 class="sub">Who Won the Space Race?</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            By landing on the moon, the United States effectively “won” the
            space race that had begun with Sputnik’s launch in 1957. For their
            part, the Soviets made four failed attempts to launch a lunar
            landing craft between 1969 and 1972, including a spectacular
            launch-pad explosion in July 1969. From beginning to end With the
            conclusion of the space race, U.S. government interest in lunar
            missions waned after the early 1970s. In 1975, the joint
            Apollo-Soyuz mission sent three U.S. astronauts into space aboard an
            Apollo spacecraft that docked in orbit with a Soviet-made Soyuz
            vehicle. When the commanders of the two crafts officially greeted
            each other, their “handshake in space” served to symbolize the
            gradual improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations in the late Cold
            War-era.

          America in the Space Race with a televised landing witnessed around
          the world by 723 million people.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>11 April 1970: </strong>

        <p>
          <strong>1 August 1971:</strong>
          David Scott, commander of the Apollo 15 mission, becomes the first
          person to drive on the Moon. He's also remembered for paying tribute
          to the Soviet Union and US astronauts who died in the advancement of
          space exploration. When walking on the Moon, Scott places a plaque
          with a list of the dead. Alongside this, he leaves a small aluminium
          sculpture of an astronaut in a spacesuit, created by Belgian artist
          Paul Van Hoeydonck.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>15 July 1975:</strong>
          With tensions between the US and USSR softening, the first cooperative
          Apollo-Soyuz mission is launched. With two separate flights, the
          Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft dock in space and the two commanders Tom
          Stafford and Alexei Leonov exchange the first international handshake.
          This act can be seen to symbolically end the Space Race, paving the
          way for future joint missions, such as the International Space Station
          and the Shuttle-Mir programme.
