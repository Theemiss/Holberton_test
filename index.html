              Space Race Between 1955-1975

            <p>
              The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War
              rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to
              achieve firsts in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in
              the ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two
              nations following World War II.
            </p>
            <p>
              The competition began in earnest on August 2, 1955, when the
              Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of
              intent to launch artificial satellites for the International
              Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite
              "in the near future". The Soviet Union achieved the first
              successful launch with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of Sputnik 1,
              and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of Yuri
              Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The USSR also sent the first woman,
              Valentina Tereshkova, to space on June 16, 1963, with numerous
              other firsts taking place over the next few years with regards to
              flight duration, spacewalks and related activities. According to
              Russian sources, these achievements led to the conclusion that the
              USSR had an advantage in space technology in the early 1960s.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Space Race has left a technology legacy of increased space
              related development and advances. It sparked increases in spending
              on education and research and development, which led to many
              spin-off effects such as the NASA Technology Transfer Program.

              In 1959, the Soviet space program took another step forward with
              the launch of Luna 2, the first space probe to hit the moon. In
              April 1961, the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first
              person to orbit Earth, traveling in the capsule-like spacecraft
              Vostok 1. For the U.S. effort to send a man into space, dubbed
              Project Mercury, NASA engineers designed a smaller, cone-shaped
              capsule far lighter than Vostok; they tested the craft with
              chimpanzees, and held a final test flight in March 1961 before the
              Soviets were able to pull ahead with Gagarinâ€™s launch. On May 5,
              astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space (though
              not in orbit).
